# StarWars
Graphic star wars game written in assembly 

Project Name: Star Wars

Project theme: Implementation of a game that simulates Star Wars in the assembler language using the various registers in order to implement the various algorithms efficiently and in optimal running time. The game features advanced machine-language graphics.

Background: Assembler is the most basic programming language in computer science. It is the closest language in the form of writing it to machine language.
In Assembler, similar to machine language, the instructions generated from the instructions of the computer software are addressed directly to the registers in the computer memory, to the computer processor, to the output ports and input commands in the most detailed manner.
The main challenge in assembler programming is the need to remember many details and to which registers in memory each and every command was directed.

Realization: The object of the game, similar to Star Wars, is to build your own star, defend it, and destroy enemy stars. To do this, the player has a limited time to find a suitable location for the star he wants to establish. Then, he must bring to the same planet, in groundbreaking space shuttles, the settlers who will build the planet and cultivate it to glory. Once the player has enough inhabitants, the real challenge begins ... Defending the planet from the galactic empire led by the evil Darth Vader, who wants to destroy the planet and turn all its inhabitants into brainwashed clones and slaves of the Galactic Empire. The game can end in two ways:
The player manages to successfully repel the multiple and incessant attack attempts of Darth Vader and the Galactic Empire, at which point the player actually becomes the new emperor of the Galactic Empire.
The actor fails and is defeated by the Galactic Empire, at which point Darth Vader takes over the planet, destroying the buildings, vegetation, and everything the actor has built. All the inhabitants become slaves of the Galactic Empire, and eventually the star is completely destroyedâ€¦

In terms of game programming, adapting it to the graphics screen and running it efficiently and optimally, I wrote an efficient code that makes proper use of computer memory. To do this, I used the various registers, to transfer data from the database using a data bus, to the computer's memory, where the data is stored for the rest of the game.
Since the game is written in assembly, a threshold language, a compiler is needed that will convert the written code into a real machine language (written at base two - 0101), with the help of which the game runs graphically and continuously on the screen.
To do this I used the software known for this - DosBox, its purpose is to get the code, analyze it, find bugs, running problems and endless loops that interfere with normal running, and then overcome the problems and translate the original code into machine language, which the computer is able to run.
